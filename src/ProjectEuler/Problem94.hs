  Idea:

  Note that every isosceles triangle can be split
  into two right triangles whose shapes are the same.
  Given the context of this problem:

  - the slope of the right triangle (say, r) must be an integer.
  - the base of this isosceles triangle must be an integer.
  - and the length of the base muse either be r-1 or r+1.
  - in addition, the problem also require area to be an integer,
    which suggests height must be a rational number.

  At this point I suspect we need to generate Pythagorean triples
  and filter through it.

  Let's use Euclid's formula:

  - a = k*(m*m - n*n)
  - b = k*(2*m*n)
  - c = k*(m*m + n*n)
  - and also require that:
    + c = 2a + 1
    + c = 2a - 1
    + c = 2b + 1
    + c = 2b - 1

  Note that in either way:

  - c - 2a = k*(3*n*n-m*m) = -1 or +1
  - c - 2b = k*(m*m+n*n-4*m*n) = -1 or +1

  k can only be 1 for this to work, so we can now just set k=1 to simplify it.

  Now the search space has been small enough for us to brute force (m,n)
  to get the final answer.
